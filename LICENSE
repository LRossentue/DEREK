ACTUALLY, this license should have been written in LaTeX with proper citations
to legal precedents and a comprehensive literature review of intellectual
property frameworks. As documented in Wright et al. (2023), "informal licensing
is suboptimal." But I suppose this... *adjusts glasses* ...suffices.

Derek does not endorse any interpretation of this license that fails to
acknowledge his intellectual contributions to the field of pedantic AI systems.

No Plenny Shake products were harmed in the making of this software.
