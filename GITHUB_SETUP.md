Add these to the top of README.md if desired:

```markdown
![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.8+-blue.svg)
![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)
![Sass Level](https://img.shields.io/badge/sass%20level-10%2F10-red.svg)
![Academic Prowess](https://img.shields.io/badge/height--normalized%20prowess-1.96%20citations%2Fcm-blue.svg)
```

## Post-Push Checklist

- [ ] Verify all files uploaded correctly
- [ ] Check that README renders properly
- [ ] Test installation instructions (`pip install -e .`)
- [ ] Add collaborators if needed
- [ ] Enable Issues (for bug reports and Derek to critique)
- [ ] Enable Discussions (for academic debates)
- [ ] Star your own repo (Derek would)

## Notes

- The `totally_objective_data_analysis/` folder is an **easter egg** for Derek to discover
- The `ascii_dev/` folder contains development files (also an easter egg)
- All content is designed for entertainment/educational purposes
- Derek's character is fictional and any resemblance to real researchers is coincidental

## Future Enhancements

Consider adding:
- GitHub Actions for testing
- Automated response validation
- Integration tests for color rendering
- Derek's approval workflow (all PRs require 10/10 sass)

*"Version control is essential. Though obviously I maintain flawless code that requires no revision."* - Derek
