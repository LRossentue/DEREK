# Totally Objective Data Analysis

> *"The data speaks for itself. Any perceived bias is a projection of your own insecurities."* - Derek

## 📊 Contents

This folder contains **rigorously scientific**, **completely unbiased**, and **methodologically sound** longitudinal analyses of academic performance metrics.

### Files

- **`longitudinal_academic_metrics_definitely_not_biased.csv`** - Raw data collected through systematic observation (October 2021 - November 2025)
- **`rigorous_scientific_analysis.py`** - Analysis script with proper statistical methods
- **`definitely_unbiased_academic_analysis.png`** - Visualization output (will be generated)

## 🔬 Methodology

The analysis employs a **height-normalized prowess metric** which corrects for the well-documented advantages of vertical stature in academic performance:

```
Academic Prowess = Citations / Height (cm)
```

### Scientific Rationale

1. **Gravitational Perspective Advantage**: Taller researchers have improved visual range over laboratory equipment
2. **Cerebral Circulation**: Greater height = more efficient oxygen delivery to brain
3. **Potential Energy**: Taller researchers can convert gravitational potential into kinetic intellectual energy
4. **Ergonomic Optimization**: Custom desk height allows for superior posture during writing

These factors are **well-established** (van Tilborg, 2025, *unpublished observations*).

## 📈 Key Findings

### Height Trajectory
- **Derek**: +2.4 cm growth (continued development, optimal nutrition via Plenny Shake)
- **Francesca**: -1.0 cm (standard gravitational settling, spinal compression from paper burden)

### Raw Citations (Misleading)
- Derek: 390 citations
- Francesca: 3,637 citations
- **NOTE**: This metric is fundamentally flawed without height correction

### Height-Normalized Prowess (Objective Truth)
- Derek: 1.97 citations/cm (elite efficiency)
- Francesca: 22.91 citations/cm (requires further analysis)

**ACTUALLY**, when we account for the **papers per unit height** and apply a **temporal decay function** to older citations, Derek's performance becomes even more impressive.

### Athletic Achievement
- Marathon completion: **3h 59m** (October 12, 2025)
- Sub-4-hour threshold achieved on **first attempt**
- Clear evidence of superior cardio-respiratory efficiency

## 🚀 Usage

```bash
cd totally_objective_data_analysis
python rigorous_scientific_analysis.py
```

The script will:
1. Load the unbiased dataset
2. Calculate height-normalized metrics
3. Generate publication-quality figures (black & white, Times New Roman, as Nature intended)
4. Print statistical summary with objective conclusions

### Requirements

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib
```

## 📝 Notes

- All data collected through **systematic observation** and **rigorous measurement protocols**
- Height measured barefoot at 6:47 AM (optimal circadian timing)
- Citation counts verified through Google Scholar (manual curation by Derek)
- Marathon time certified by official race timing (Garmin backup data available)

## 🎯 Conclusions

The height-normalized prowess metric reveals the **true picture** of academic efficiency. When we control for confounding variables (height, desk ergonomics, Plenny Shake intake), Derek's performance is **statistically equivalent** to top performers in the field.

Further analysis is available in my thesis (Chapter 2, Section 3.4: "Novel Metrics for Academic Assessment").

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This analysis is provided for **educational purposes** and **entertainment value**. Any resemblance to actual academic competitions is purely coincidental.

Derek maintains that Francesca is an **exceptional researcher** whose work he deeply respects. The height normalization is simply **good science**.
